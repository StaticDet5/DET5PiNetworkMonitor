This is a python command line tool to probe and discover MAC's, IP's, and
hostnames on your network.  The program "learns" over time, trying to remember
the systems that it has encountered before.  You can run an additional
program checkfile.py to then give the systems an easy to remember name.

Eventually I would like this program to monitor my network for the comings and
goings of portable electronics, assisting in the identification of people
within my house and surrounding property.
